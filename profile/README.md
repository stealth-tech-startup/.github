IaC via HashiCorp
-----------------

We used to love HashiCorp but we are now frustrated with its major mis-actions that hurt us as a country, including

- [Participating in the China-Ban](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11888) (we know it's about government, but we don't care!)
- [Close-sourcing its techs, such as documentation](https://github.com/hashicorp/dev-portal/blob/main/docs/README.md):

We predict that HashiCorp is going to keep shrinking its Open Source community and, thus, maintain a copy of what we depends here in case HashiCorp closes them:

- [HashiCorp Dev Portal](https://github.com/stealth-tech-startup/hashicorp-dev-portal)
- [HashiCorp Packer](https://github.com/stealth-tech-startup/hashicorp-packer)

  - [AWS Plugin](https://github.com/stealth-tech-startup/packer-plugin-amazon)

- [HashiCorp Terraform](https://github.com/stealth-tech-startup/hashicorp-terraform)
- [HashiCorp Vault](https://github.com/stealth-tech-startup/hashicorp-vault)
- [HashiCorp Vagrant](https://github.com/stealth-tech-startup/hashicorp-vagrant)
